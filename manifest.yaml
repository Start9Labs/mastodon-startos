install-alert: |
  After starting mastodon for the first time, it can take a long time (several minutes) to be ready.
  Please be patient. On future starts of the service, it will be faster, but still takes longer than other services.
  Make sure to sign up for a user before giving out your link. The first user to sign up is set as the admin user.
